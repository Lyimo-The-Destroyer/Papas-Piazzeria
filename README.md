# Papas-Piazzeria

This project seeks to investigate the factors influencing flood impact across Toronto, with the goal of understanding who, where, and what is most at risk during heavy rainfall events. 
By analyzing diverse datasets, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships that can inform future urban planning and flood management efforts.

# Running the Analysis

Anaconda is recommended for running code for this project, some additional packages may need to be installed to properly run the code.
We recommend first running "CHMC Income Webscraping" to get the medium neighbourhood income data for future reference. Following this, "Climate Analysis" should be run, as it is necessary to create csv's that are used in the future. "Flow data analysis" should be run next, followed by "Daniel Data Wrangling", "Neighbourhood Demographics Analysis", then "Zoning, Neighbourhood, and Flooding Analysis".

Most files needed are available on the github, however, the geojson for the Floodline_TRCA_Polygon was too large to upload and can be found at the following address: https://trca-camaps.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/16356f40517d4e32aca9c86b257198e0_1/explore

Lyimo: Processed geospatial data utilizing QGIS in order for map data compilation. Conducted exploratory analysis for correlations of percentage flooding per neighbourhood and neighbourhood demographic data. Calculated vulnerability indexes for neighbourhoods and explored similar correlations to flood data.
